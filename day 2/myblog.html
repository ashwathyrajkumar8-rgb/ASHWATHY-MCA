<p><strong>If you’ve ever felt the tension between respecting governing authorities and living out your allegiance to King Jesus, you’re not alone.</strong></p>
<p>We live in some of the most politically charged and polarizing environments. As Christ-followers, we’re called to uniquely be of two worlds simultaneously. Like a spiritual amphibian, we are both citizens of earth and citizens of heaven (Philippians 1:27; 3:20). In Romans 13:1–7, Paul gives instruction to the church in Rome, the heart of the empire, to live in submission and honor to governing authorities. For many of us, we read this passage with our own set of caveats. Let’s be honest, we have a different take on this passage depending on if the person we voted for is in office or not! But Paul’s instruction is not for submission, if you like the rulers. And that’s where the challenge for us lies. How do we live as dual citizens of heaven and earth? Here are just a few thoughts inspired from Scripture to lead us the right way.</p>
